### 👋 Hey there! I'm Suleman 👨🏾‍🚀

🚀 About Me:
- 🌍 Based in Oslo, Norway, I'm a 32-year-old tech enthusiast with a curious mind that never stops exploring. Whether it's the latest in AI, quantum computing, or a new coding challenge, I'm always on the hunt for something new to learn.
- 🎓 Currently mastering the art of Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at OsloMet, I'm diving deep into the world of advanced techniques and programming to create innovative solutions.
- 💼 Consultant by day at Tribia AS, and a coding ninja by night, I love turning complex problems into simple, efficient solutions.
- 🏃‍♂️ When not coding, I'm probably out running, flexing my muscles at the gym, or scoring goals on the football field.

🔨 Projects:
- 🌐 Master Thesis on Quantum Simulation based on Bohmian Mechanics – Unraveling the mysteries of quantum physics with computer simulations.
- ⚽ Analyzing and Predicting Fantasy Premier League Performances – Combining my love for football with data science.
- 📈 3D CGAN for innovative 3D image generation – Pushing the boundaries of machine learning and image processing.

🎯 I'm passionate about:
- Solving real-world problems with technology.
- Continuously learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
- Making a positive impact and inspiring others along the way.
